A tool to get daily news from [The Daily star](https://www.thedailystar.net).

### Requirements
* Dmenu
* st
* w3m

### Installation 
```sh
$ sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8amiul/the-daily-star-cli/main/news" -o /usr/local/bin/news
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/news
```

### Modification

<p>
You may not have Dmenu or st. so for that you can change dmenu to fzf.
And for st you can just remove that part (st -e) from the last line.
But now you need to open a terminal then execute the script.
for w3m you can use any terminal based browser such as surf,lynx etc
